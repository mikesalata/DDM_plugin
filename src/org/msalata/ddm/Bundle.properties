OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin provides new measure of node groups centrality - Dispersal degree measure.\n\
    Instead of calculating centrality from one node perspective, plugin focuses on\ncalculating centrality of selected nodes groups and compare group centrality to\nother groups.\n\n\
    You can choose number of nodes from all nodes of current graph and let the algoritm to\nselect the most important nodes group for given group size.\n\
    Plugin supports directed and undirected graphs.\n\n\
    Algorithm is based on connected components algorithms for directed and undirected graphs\nTo increase aglorithm performance optimized versions were created.\n\n\
    As part of the plugin they have also been established optimizations based on the fundamental measures of centrality, such as:\n- Degree centrality,\n- Eigenvector centrality.\n- Betweenness centrality,\n- Closeness centrality,\n- Radius centrality.
